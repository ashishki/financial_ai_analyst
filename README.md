# Financial Market Analysis and Forecasting System

The project is a comprehensive financial market analysis and forecasting system that integrates multiple modules to provide in-depth insights into financial markets. It covers the full pipeline—from data collection to reporting—making it a powerful tool for both demonstration and real-world applications.

## Key Components

- **Data Collection:**  
  - **YahooFinanceCollector and CSVDataCollector:** Fetch historical financial data from Yahoo Finance and CSV files, respectively.
  - **DataAggregator:** Combines data from multiple sources and computes average prices.

- **Data Analysis:**  
  - **SummaryStatistics and MovingAverageAnalysis:** Compute basic statistics and moving averages on financial data.
  - **DataAnalyzer:** Aggregates different analysis methods to provide a comprehensive view of the data.

- **Prediction:**  
  - **ProphetPredictor and ArimaPredictor:** Implement time series forecasting using Prophet and ARIMA models.
  - **ForecastEvaluator:** Evaluates and compares forecast models and can create ensemble forecasts.

- **Visualization:**  
  - **FinancialDataVisualizer:** Uses Bokeh to create interactive charts for visualizing price trends, moving averages, and forecast comparisons.

- **Reporting:**  
  - **HTMLReportGenerator and PlainTextReportGenerator:** Generate detailed reports in both HTML and plain text formats, summarizing analysis, forecasts, and visualizations.

## Achievements

- **Data Integration:** Successfully integrates data from multiple sources, normalizes it, and computes average prices.
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Provides detailed analysis using summary statistics and moving averages.
- **Forecasting:** Implements robust forecasting models (Prophet and ARIMA) and evaluates their performance. Supports ensemble forecasting.
- **Visualization:** Creates interactive visualizations that help users understand trends and forecast comparisons.
- **Reporting:** Generates clear and detailed reports in both HTML and plain text formats, making it easy to share insights.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test coverage ensures the reliability of each module, covering edge cases and typical scenarios.

## Additional Highlights

- **Flexibility and Extensibility:**  
  The system is designed with modularity in mind, allowing for the easy addition of new data sources, analysis methods, forecasting models, and reporting formats without changing the core API.

- **Integration and Reliability:**  
  With extensive testing using Pytest, the project ensures high reliability and robustness. Every module is covered by unit tests to catch and handle edge cases effectively.

- **Interactivity:**  
  Utilizing interactive visualization libraries such as Bokeh, the system enables dynamic exploration of financial trends and forecasts, providing a more engaging user experience.
